Hahatay is adopting the [eReuse software suite](https://ereuse.org/en/), specifically Devicehub and Workbench, to enhance its inventory management. This marks a significant step forward in efficiently tracking and managing the numerous refurbished laptops received through the Labdoo initiative. Currently in its beta testing phase (as detailed [here](https://ereuse.org/en/2025/02/12/working-new-devicehub/)), the eReuse software is already providing valuable insights to the organization, while we also provide feedback to the developers for further software enhancements. Key benefits experienced by Hahatay include:

* **Devicehub for Inventory Tasks:** Thanks to [the support of the Labdoo initiative](https://platform.labdoo.org/edoovillage?e=108374), Hahatay has received a significant number of laptops. Managing this influx has been challenging, but Devicehub provides a centralized system to accurately track the hardware of every laptop in our inventory.
* **Devicehub for assignment and availability:** Devicehub also facilitates the tracking of laptop assignments to workers and volunteers, as well as the availability of devices. This ensures efficient distribution and eliminates confusion regarding device allocation.
* **Workbench for Diagnostics:** The Workbench component enables the easy reading of technical specifications for each laptop and allows for thorough diagnostics to confirm proper functionality. This significantly streamlines the process of preparing laptops for deployment.

Even in its beta phase, the eReuse software is demonstrating its potential to substantially improve Hahatay's inventory management processes. This increased efficiency allows the team to focus more on our core mission and ensures the effective utilization of received laptops.

Hahatay is proud to be part of the eReuse community and contribute to the development of this powerful open-source tool. The source code for devicehub and workbench is available on the [eReuse GitHub repository](https://github.com/eReuse)

Stay tuned for more updates as Hahatay continues to integrate and utilize the eReuse software.
