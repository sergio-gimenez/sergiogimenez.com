This morning, we woke up without any rush, as last night's party went on longer than expected. We took a stroll around the neighborhood with the intention of eating at the same place as yesterday, but since it was Sunday, the women had closed the stall.

The kiosk owner told us that there was an open place at the end of the street, so we decided to head there. We all ate Thie Bou Djen Rouge together, which, though tasty, did not quite compare to the one Daba usually prepares for us at Hahatay.

With our stomachs full, we returned home to rest for a while and avoid the hottest hours of the day. Everyone, except Sergio, who preferred to stay and rest, went to the laundromat to wash clothes and then exchanged some extra CFAS for the upcoming days.

Later, we met again at a bar with an ocean view, where we witnessed another breathtaking African sunset.

There, the younger mathematicians gave us a formal demonstration of the following statement:

"A monkey would write Don Quixote infinitely many times if it randomly typed on a keyboard for an infinite amount of time."

Roger, Sergio, and Jaume were amazed by the abstract thinking of the young mathematicians. This type of knowledge exchange among all team members allows us all to learn new things, both the more experienced ones and the younger ones alike.
