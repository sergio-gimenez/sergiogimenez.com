My first week at Boston University is already complete, and I'm so happy to be here in Boston! Everyone has been incredibly kind, and the faculty and staff are all super approachable and welcoming.

For the Fall 2025 semester, I'll be spending the next three months on a research stay at BU's MET College. I'm excited to be working with an amazing group: Professor John Day, Dean Lou Chitkushev, and Dr. Maryan Rizinski.

Our project is focused on the future of mobile networks. We'll be working to show that today's network architecture might not be the right fit for the demands of 6G, especially in terms of scalability and mobility. Our goal is to prove that a new, more efficient protocol architecture that we're calling **6G-RUPA** can help future 6G networks scale effectively.

What makes this experience so special is that 6G-RUPA is based on the **Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA)**, which was developed by Professor John Day. It feels like a gift to be able to share and develop ideas with him and the rest of the team on a daily basis.

This work will be a major part of my PhD thesis, and I already know it's going to be an incredible experience, both for my career and for me personally. I'm looking forward to everything that's ahead!
