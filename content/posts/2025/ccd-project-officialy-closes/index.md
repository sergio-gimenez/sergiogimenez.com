## The collaboration project with UPC's CCD comes to an end

After months of work, the **2024-A027** project from the Centre de Cooperació per al Desenvolupament (CCD) of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya has officially concluded. This project, titled "Deployment of infrastructure for a radio and community network in Gandiol, Senegal", has represented a significant advancement in the technological infrastructure for the Hahatay network.

The project's main objective has been to improve Hahatay's IT and network infrastructure, building upon the work carried out over the previous three years. During this latest iteration of the project, several important milestones have been achieved:

**Network infrastructure strengthening:**

- Implementation of a monitoring, automation and remote management system using **OpenWisp** and **Zabbix**
- Establishment of a new, more robust and stable VPN system for remote access
- Simplification of network maintenance without requiring high technical knowledge

**Coverage expansion:**

- Improvement of WiFi coverage in key points of the association (Aminata, Nité, Radio)
- Extension of intranet and VPN services to Hahatay spaces in Saint Louis (Ndar Weesul and Jang Kom)
- Adaptation to new constructions and spaces that have emerged in the association

**Equipment and resources:**

- Supply of equipment such as computers, screens and keyboards through **Labdoo** and other private entities
- Provision of material for volunteers and association workers

**Construction of an antenna for the Gem Sunu Bopp community radio:**

- With part of the CCD budget, an 11-meter antenna is being built for the Gem Sunu Bopp community radio, which is expected to be operational in the coming months.

### The participating team

The project has involved the participation of five UPC students:

- **Joan Torres**
- **Aitor Da Rocha**
- **Sergio Giménez**
- **Jaume Motje**
- **Roger González**

All participants' evaluations agree in highlighting the experience as tremendously enriching both academically and personally and culturally, emphasizing Hahatay's hospitality and the transformative impact of cultural exchange.

### Continuity perspectives

Although no new project has been submitted for the current call, the team maintains daily contact with Hahatay, monitoring the network and solving problems remotely from Barcelona thanks to the deployed tools.

The main idea is to continue with this telematic support until the next call, evaluating the network's behavior and new technologies that can substantially improve the quality of service.

### Acknowledgments

We want to express our deepest gratitude to the **Centre de Cooperació per al Desenvolupament de la UPC** for making this project possible with a grant of **€3,337.50**, and of course to the entire team of students who have dedicated their time and knowledge to this noble cause.

This project represents a perfect example of how technological cooperation can generate real impact in communities, while greatly enriching those who participate in it.
