We are thrilled to announce the completion and inauguration of a new classroom in Tabax Nite, which is a project located within Hahatay. This project, which we have been diligently working on, is now ready to serve the community of Gandiol!

The classroom is equipped with refurbished laptops provided by the [Labdoo initiative](https://platform.labdoo.org/edoovillage?e=108374). These laptops will significantly enhance the learning experience of the students in Tabax Nite by providing access to a wealth of educational resources. The classroom will cater to students of all ages participating in the educational programs offered by Hahatay, such as the **Hahatay academie** linked programs such as the European funded project: "**DOUNDEL: Revitaliser la Culture Locale et la Communication Digitale pour un Développement Durable, l’autonomisation et la Formation des Jeunes et Femmes de Gandiol et Saint-Louis"**.

This classroom is a testament to the dedication and hard work of all the volunteers involved in this project over the past years. It is equipped with WiFi, utilizing the bandwidth from the community network in Tabax Nite. This marks a significant step forward in the digitalization of the village, and we are incredibly proud of this achievement.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to support and develop educational initiatives in Tabax Nite.
