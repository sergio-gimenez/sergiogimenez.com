title: Execution is King

> "Having a plan, even a bad plan, is better than no plan at all."

As a Product Manager, more often than not, I notice people mixing up _ideas_ and _execution_ in discussions. Both these concepts have entirely unique levels of fidelity to what the finished product will be. It’s important for Product Managers to know the difference between these two concepts, how to manage them, and what importance they should have at different stages of the product development cycle. Not understanding the differences between an _idea_ and an _execution_ isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a significant obstacle to innovation and strategic execution for products and companies. 

## Definitions
### What is an Idea?
An idea is a concept or a vision. It’s the initial spark of creativity that suggests a new way of doing something, solving a user pain point, or addressing a need. Ideas are abundant and can range from the mundane to the revolutionary. However, ideas by themselves are intangible and hold potential rather than value. A well-defined idea should focus on describing what problem is being solved, who has it, and an initial vision for what the solution could look like.

### What is Execution?
Execution is the process of taking an idea and turning it into reality. It involves planning, development, and implementation. Execution is where strategy, skill, and effort come into play to transform a concept into a product, service, or result. Unlike ideas, execution is tangible, measurable, and ultimately, what delivers value. A well-planned execution will break down the initial idea&vision into workable chunks that can be planned, tested, and measured for outcomes.

## Problems
Usually, people tend to split the above in a very simplistic way: ideas are about **what** and **why**, while execution is about **how** and **when**. This view is part of the issue. Both concepts ultimately are about **something** that has different fidelity levels defining it across time. As a team progresses in working on an idea, the level of ambiguity decreases while the definition increases. E.g., an idea becomes a mockup, the mockup becomes a prototype, that prototype becomes a real app running on a device.
