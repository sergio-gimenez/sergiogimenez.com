My name is Sergio Gim√©nez, I'm from Barcelona. However, currently I live between Barcelona and Teruel, a beautiful small city located in the so called "empty spain".

I have both a bachelor and master's degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. Currently I'm pursuing a PhD in the Compute Architecture Deparment. My research is focused on the development of new algorithms and protocols for the next generation of mobile networks, we call it [6G-RUPA][6grupa].

At my job I work as a researcher üßë‚Äçüéì in the Software Networks area at the [i2cat Foundation][i2cat], a non-profit research and innovation center. You can see my research in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Z6J9QoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I'm also leading a volunteer-driven community network in [Hahatay][hahatay], [Gandiol Senegal](gandiol) :senegal:. We are building a community network to provide internet access to the local population. You can learn more about the project at [hahatay.network](https://hahatay.network).

Recently, I started contributing to [eReuse.org][ereuse] :recycle:, a non-profit organization that aims to reduce electronic waste by promoting the reuse of electronic devices.

All in all, I'm interested in different subjects such as software engineering, networks, distributed systems and privacy in general.

Besides being a **massive nerd** I also have several hobbies: I love hiking :hiking_boot:, climbing :climbing:, travelling :airplane:, playing music :guitar: and reading :book:.

My mother comes from a little tiny village in the mountains of Teruel, called El Cuervo :black_bird: so I go there often a lot to visit my family and enjoy the nature. I'm also making my own wine this year :wine_glass:.
